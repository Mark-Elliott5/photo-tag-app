This monorepo is made for deploying my photo-tag-backend and photo-tag-frontend to hosting providers.

This app is a Where's Waldo-like game where players are given 5 random characters out of 33 to find. The characters are from various media franchises. Once you win, you can submit your name and see if you made the leaderboard. You are given one place on the leaderboard (unless your cookie goes bye-bye). Your time can only be overwritten by yourself if you surpass your previous best time.
